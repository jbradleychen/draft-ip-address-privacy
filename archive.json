Users can consult library materials with a useful measure of anonymity and privacy.

For example, a public discussion platform with a culture of anonymity may redirect traffic to YouTube as a video library, bypassing YouTube defenses that otherwise reduce exposure of potentially harmful content. Similarly, a minor could be solicited by an adult impersonating a child on a popular social media platform, then redirected to a smaller, less established and less defended platform where illegal activity could occur. There are many such cross-platform abuse models and they cause significant public harm. In a world with strong cross-platform privacy barriers, how should such threats be managed?\r\n",

If I understand correctly, at a minimum, the service provider (Youtube) only see the client's IP address and possibly a referrer. In a world with IP address privacy, the service won't see the client's true IP address and the browser may truncate the referrer. Are there specific mitigations you already have in place for this situation that you can describe?\r\n\r\nFor the second example, while these platforms should provide some oversight/protection within their walls, they cannot and should not be responsible for potential harm that occurs on other sites. In general, protecting a child is their guardian/parent's responsibility, and this is the case regardless of which site they're on.\r\n\r\nBased on these two examples, I'm not sure there is a one-size-fits-all answer for this problem.

Without a proxy, YouTube could better estimate the number of distinct users, geographic distribution, and other useful demographics. This isn't really about specific mitigations, it is more about the investigation that supports understanding a threat and designing specific mitigations. In the extreme, abuse fighting is reduced to waiting for a disaster and then cleaning up the mess. This is not a good outcome for public safety. There is no single counterabuse signal more important than IP address.\r\n\r\nThe above assumes high-traffic volumes. I think the second example is representative of the low-traffic case. \r\n\r\nFor the second example, parents have a responsibility for being responsible parents. Governments have a responsibility for making responsible parenting possible. When the environment for parenting includes features that are particularly dangerous, and that are harming children, at a certain point a legitimate government is compelled to mitigate the danger, lest they lose the confidence of the people. Such government interventions can avoided if the systems in question self regulate. The radio and the printing press are examples of revolutionary technologies that contributed to tremendous disruption and later became safer through regulation and through industry norms.\r\n\r\nThese threat models represent significant public safety risks and harms. Achieving safety is not so simple as IP address transparency, as we have that today, and things are still getting worse. That is driving the industry towards systems that are less available for anonymous, unverified users, a bad outcome for privacy. To preserve anonymous service access we need to recognize and mitigate features that threaten privacy or safety.",

The first is a small set of attackers pretending to be many to prevent their abuse from being detected and blocked, which is generally the case when it comes to Denial of Service attacks (which is why distributed Denial of Service is a useful attack pattern). \r\n\r\nThe second category is when an attacker is attempting to impersonate a victim. This is the case with credential theft in general and can be protected against with technologies such as WebAuthn and techniques such as 2FA. \r\n\r\nBeing specific about the types of abuse will help us determine the types of preventative measures that may be appropriate.\r\n\r\nI will note that these two categories are intentionally scoped to a single system. There is a third broad category where independant systems can use IP addresses as identifiers to warn others of threats. rfc5782 is one example of a standardized system to share such threat intelligence. This would also include tying an IP address to a real world identity.\r\n\r\nAnd of course if there are other broad categories I'm missing, we should identify and define them.",
