      "body": "At a very broad level, I believe there are two forms of abuse against a single system that an IP privacy solution must consider. The first is a small set of attackers pretending to be many to prevent their abuse from being detected and blocked, which is generally the case when it comes to Denial of Service attacks (which is why distributed Denial of Service is a useful attack pattern). \r\n\r\nThe second category is when an attacker is attempting to impersonate a victim. This is the case with credential theft in general and can be protected against with technologies such as WebAuthn and techniques such as 2FA. \r\n\r\nBeing specific about the types of abuse will help us determine the types of preventative measures that may be appropriate.\r\n\r\nI will note that these two categories are intentionally scoped to a single system. There is a third broad category where independant systems can use IP addresses as identifiers to warn others of threats. rfc5782 is one example of a standardized system to share such threat intelligence. This would also include tying an IP address to a real world identity.\r\n\r\nAnd of course if there are other broad categories I'm missing, we should identify and define them.",
